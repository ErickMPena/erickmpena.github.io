                I was born in Mexico in the city of Mascota, Jalisco. In the early 2000s, my parents
                came to the United States in search for a better life for me and my siblings. They ultimately decided
                to live in South Gate, a city in the southeast side of Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph" id="la body2">
                From 2013-2017, I attended South Gate High School and became very involved with my community. During
                High School, I learned about the disadvantages of surrounding the communities such as poverty,
                low graduation rates, and underrepresented voices.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph" id="la body3">
                This is what inspired me to go above and beyond what was expected of me, I wanted to go out there
                and defy the odds.
